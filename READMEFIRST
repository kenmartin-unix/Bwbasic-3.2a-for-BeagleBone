This should work under most any Linux and Linux under
WSL (Ubuntu, Debian) for windows at the command prompt.

If running this under Linux you will need 'gcc' compiler.
To see if it's installed type in  gcc --version  if OK
then simply do the following:

tar -xf bwbasic-3.2a.tar

cd <here>

To make 'cls' work as it does in DOS perform once

sudo ln /usr/bin/clear /usr/bin/cls

Now lets build bwbasic

sh compile

Read prompts

That's it.

bwbasic and renum are in /usr/local/bin

If you want bwbasic to work from a GUI:
(1) copy bwbasic.sh to a suitable location
    and make sure to  chmod 755 bwbasic.sh
    so it's executable.
(2) copy bwbasic.png to a suitable location
(3) edit bwbasic.desktop and change references
    for File Location then cp bwbasic.desktop to ~/Desktop/.
    and it should work from the desktop.

If running under Windows 10 you will need 'gcc' compiler.
To see if it's installed type in  gcc --version  if you
think you have gcc installed verify your 'path'. If OK
then at the command prompt

cd <here>

compile.bat

Read prompts

That's it.

Move bwbasic.exe and renum.exe to locations in your path.

There are many, many examples in BAS-EXAMPLES and information
in INFO.

All should work fine. But as usual no guarentee is implied.
